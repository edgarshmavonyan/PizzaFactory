# PizzaFactory

Required dependencies:

* CMake

Here you can see an automatized pizza factory. To work with it, you need to create a waiter
and a pizza chef.

Then, use getOrder() and manageOrder() methods to order meal.

Some features were tested with google Test.

We used Builder pattern in the project for pizzas, and abstract factory for salads.

### To start the program, while in project directory, run in bash:

```bash
bash build.sh
```

# Enjoy yummy pizza!
